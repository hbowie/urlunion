Version 2.00 (2013-04-14)
-------------------------

* URL Union is now open source software, licensed under Apache License 2.0.
* Users may now import URLs from a tab-delimited text file with a .txt file extension or an Excel spreadsheet with an .xls extension.
* An entry with a Title but no URL is now permitted and treated as a placeholder until the URL can be determined at a future point in time. Duplicate titles are not allowed.

Version 1.20 (2012-08-22)
-------------------------

* Changed URL label to a button that can be used to select a local file or folder as a URL.

Version 1.10 (2011-12-29)
-------------------------

* New users will now have their first set of bookmarks saved automatically for them in a default location, in a URL Union folder within their Documents folder.
* The Favorites prefs now include a list of tags for which favorites pages should be generated. &quot;Favorites&quot; is the default, but other tags may be used, and one page will be generated for each specified tag.
* A Replace item can now be found under the List menu. Selecting this menu item opens a new Replace Window. The new window allows the user to specify which fields to search, and whether case sensitivity is desired. From this window the user has buttons to Find, Replace, Replace & Find or Replace All.
* Publish Now has been added as an additional menu item on the File menu. Additionally, the lower right hand corner of the window now displays a message upon completion of a publishing operation.

Version 1.00 (2011-01-09)
-------------------------

* Improved formatting of Favorites page in several ways. Added two new user preferences, to specify the number of columns and the number of rows desired. Also modified the line-counting logic to fit as many complete sections as possible within a column, given the user's requested maximum number of lines.

Version 0.91 (2010-02-25)
-------------------------

* Added Tools / Options menu as an alternate way to access the application preferences on a Mac (and the only way to access them on a non-Mac device).
* Corrected a bug that caused the Browse Local Index to fail when running on Windows.

Version 0.90 (2009-12-30)
-------------------------

* Initial release of URL Union.
